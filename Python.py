#this syntax to create a variable and assign a value to this variable:
# syntax : <var_name> = <value>
#For example:

age = 56
name = "Nora"
color = "Blue"
grades = [67, 100, 87, 56]

#Hello, World! Program in Python
#Before we start diving into the data types and data structures that you can use in Python, let's see how you can write your first Python program.
#You just need to call the print() function and write "Hello, World!" within parentheses:

print("Hello, World!")
print (name)

#You will see this message after running the program:
#"Hello, World!"

#Data Types and Built-in Data Structures in Python
#We have several basic data types and built-in data structures that we can work with in our programs. Each one has its own particular applications. Let's see them in detail.
#Numeric Data Types in Python: Integers, Floats, and Complex

#Integers
#Integers are numbers without decimals. You can check if a number is an integer with the type() function. If the output is <class 'int'>, then the number is an integer.
#For example:
number = 1
print(type(number))
#<class 'int'>
print(type(15))
#<class 'int'>
